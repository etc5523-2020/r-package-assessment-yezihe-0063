The goal of covidtrack is to export a Shiny App to show the COVID-19
cases and community mobility changes due to the pandemic.

## Installation

You can install the released version of covidtrack from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("covidtrack")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-yezihe-0063)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-yezihe-0063")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(covidtrack)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.
